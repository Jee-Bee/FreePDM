# FreePDM
A PDM for FreeCAD

The Admin page. 

To be honest, I think that a separate Admin panel needs to be there, apart from FreePDM.

Todo:
- [ ] Add login screen
- [ ] Add roles for the type of use, such as Architecture, mechanical, etc) 
- [ ] Add a path to the location of the files
- [ ] Allow to make different numbering scheme's
- [ ] Allow to make different version types (release A-1, or 1..10, or 1.0..10.0). I prefer just 1..x but others maybe not.
- [ ] Add logging
