## Requirements Document

The file below contains 4 tabs.
In the following paragraphs are a explanation of every tab.

[Spreadsheet with requirements](FreePDM_04-Requirements.fods)

### Explanation on the third Tab

The third Tab is added to mention all the assumptions done.
These should be tracked as well

### Explanation on the second Tab

The second tab contains all the definitions.
**All definitions start also within the requirements with a capital letter**.
This is done to make aware there is something _special_ with it.
If a requirement contains a word that is part of the definitions but has no capital letter. please change it.

### Explanation on the first Tab

The first tab is the most important.
This tab contain all the requirements.
Every line contain a 

- requirement id
- level
- traced from
- the requirements
- a note(optionally)

For example there is a requirement:
_The System provide capability to trace Revision history_.
This requirement has _requirement ID_:1 and is a system level requirement so _level_ 0.
and another requirement
_Every File Shall have a Revision_.
This requirement has _ID_ 1 as a parent and so it _trace back to_ requirement _ID_ 1.
Defining the (system )level is more difficult.
